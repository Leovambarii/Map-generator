<h1>Voronoi Map Generator with Perlin Noise </h1>

This project is a Python and Tkinter-based map generator that uses Voronoi maps and Perlin noise to generate maps with options to input a seed, 
change the number of initial points (affects final number of biomes), and see every step of map generation.


To run the program, you will need to install the following libraries:
* Python
* Tkinter
* Noise

To run the project, simply run the Generator_app.py file after cloning or downloading the repository.
